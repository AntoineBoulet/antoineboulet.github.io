**Research**  
As a theoretical physicist, my research interests are primarily focused on quantum many-body problems and development of *ab initio*, i.e. from first principle, density functional theories with applications to nuclear, atomic, and condensed matter physics.

**Currently**  
I am associate professor in physics at the ISMANS CESI engineering school in Le Mans (France) for the integrated preparatory cycle (undergraduate) and for the engineering cycle (graduate).
The subjects I teach are physics, chemistry, mathematics and programming.

**Previously**  
I was a research assistant professor in the Nuclear Theory Group at the Warsaw University of Technology under the direction of [Gabriel Wlazłowski](http://wlazlowski.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) and [Piotr Magierski](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~magiersk).
I extended the superfluid local density approximation and I investigated vortices, Higgs modes, and other collective behavior aspects related to superfluidity in many-body systems.  

Before that, I worked with [Scott Bogner](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/bogner.html) and [Witek Nazarewicz](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/witek.html) in the theory group of FRIB/NSCL at Michigan State University as a research associate.
I was working on the development of microscopically motivated DFT using *ab initio* theories and their implementation for large‑scale calculations of nuclei.  

Since 2019, I have held a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Paris-Saclay.
Prepared at IPN Orsay and supervised by [Denis Lacroix](https://sites.google.com/view/lacroixhomepage), the thesis was entitled *Density Functional Theory for Fermi systems with large s‑wave scattering length: application to atomic and nuclear physics*.
