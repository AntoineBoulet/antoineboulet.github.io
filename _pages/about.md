**Research**  
As a theoretical physicist, my research interests are primarily focused on quantum many-body problems and development of *ab initio*, i.e. from first principle, density functional theories with applications to nuclear, atomic, chemistry, and condensed matter physics.

**Currently**  
I am associate professor in physics at the ISMANS CESI engineering school in Le Mans (France) for the integrated preparatory cycle (undergraduate) and for the engineering cycle (graduate).
The subjects I teach are physics, chemistry, mathematics and programming.

**Previously**

  with [Gabriel Wlazłowski](http://wlazlowski.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) and [Piotr Magierski](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~magiersk)
- FRIB/NSCL @ Michigan State University <br>
  with [Scott Bogner](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/bogner.html) and [Witek Nazarewicz](https://nscl.msu.edu/directory/witek.html)
