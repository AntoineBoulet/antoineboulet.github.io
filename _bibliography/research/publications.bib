 	abstract = {We investigate the life cycle of the large amplitude Higgs mode in strongly interacting superfluid Fermi gas. Through numerical simulations with time-dependent density functional theory and the technique of the interaction quench, we verify the previous theoretical predictions on the modeâ€™s frequency. Next, we demonstrate that the mode is dynamically unstable against external perturbation and qualitatively examine the emerging state after the mode decays. The post-decay state is characterized by spatial fluctuations of the order parameter and density at scales comparable to the superfluid coherence length scale. We identify similarities with FFLO states, which become more prominent at higher dimensionalities and nonzero spin imbalances.},

The enhancement of the dissipative process is pronounced for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction regime, and it was suggested that the effect is due to the presence of quasiparticles localized inside the vortex core. We test this hypothesis through numerical simulations with time-dependent density functional theory: a fully microscopic framework with fermionic degrees of freedom. The results of fully microscopic calculations expose the impact of the vortex-bound states on dissipative dynamics in a fermionic superfluid. Their contribution is too weak to explain the experimental measurements, and we identify that thermal effects, giving rise to mutual friction between superfluid and the normal component, dominate the observed dynamics.},

 	abstract = {Over the past two decades, many studies in the Density Functional Theory context revealed new aspects and properties of strongly correlated superfluid quantum systems in numerous configurations that can be simulated in experiments. This was made possible by the generalization of the Local Density Approximation to superfluid systems by Bulgac in [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.65.051305">Phys. Rev. C <b>65</b>, 051305, (2002)</a>, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.040502">Phys. Rev. A <b>76</b>, 040502, (2007)</a>]. In the presented work, we propose an extension of the Superfluid Local Density Approximation systematically improvable and applicable to a large range of many-body quantum problems getting rid of the fitting procedures of the functional parameters. It turns out that only the knowledge of the density dependence of the quasi-particle properties, namely, the chemical potential, the effective mass, and the pairing gap function, are enough to obtain an explicit and accurate local functional of the densities without any adjustment a posteriori. This opens the way toward an Effective Field Theory formulation of the Density Functional Theory in the sense that we obtain a universal expansion of the functional parameters entering in the theory as a series in pairing gap function. Finally, we discuss possible applications of the developed approach allowing precise analysis of experimental observations. In that context, we focus our applications on the static structure properties of superfluid vortices.},

	abbr = {JPG},
	abstract = {In the present work, we start from a minimal Hamiltonian for Fermi systems where the \(s\)-wave scattering is the only low energy constant (LEC) at play. The many-body perturbative approach that is usually valid at rather low density is first discussed. We then use the resummation technique with the ladder approximation to obtain compact expressions for both the energy and/or the on-shell self-energy in infinite spin-degenerated systems. The diagrammatic resummation technique has the advantage in general to be predictive in a region of density larger compared to many-body perturbation theory. It also leads to a non-diverging limit as \(|a_s|\to+\infty\). Still, the obtained expressions are a rather complex function of the Fermi momentum \(k_F\). We introduce the full phase-space or the partial phase-space approximations respectively applied to the energy or to the self-energy to simplify their dependences in terms of \((a_sk_F)\) while keeping the correct limit at low density and the non-diverging property at large \(|a_sk_F|\). Quasi-particle properties of the Fermi system in various regimes of density and scattering length are then illustrated. Our conclusion is that such simplified expressions where the direct link is made with the LEC without fine-tuning can provide a clear guidance to obtain density functional theory (DFT) beyond the perturbative regime. However, quasi-particle properties close or near unitarity cannot be reproduced unless this limit is explicitly used as a constraint. We finally discuss how such approximate treatment of quasi-particles can guide the development of DFT for strongly interacting Fermi systems.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamical ground-state properties and static response in both cold atoms at or close to unitarity and neutron matter are determined using a recently proposed Density Functional Theory (DFT) based on the \(s\)-wave scattering length as, effective range re, and unitary gas limit. In cold atoms, when the effective range may be neglected, we show that the pressure, chemical potential, compressibility modulus and sound velocity obtained with the DFT are compatible with experimental observations or exact theoretical estimates. The static response in homogeneous infinite systems is also obtained and a possible influence of the effective range on the response is analyzed. The neutron matter differs from unitary gas due to the non infinite scattering length and to a significant influence of effective range which affects all thermodynamical quantities as well as the static response. In particular, we show for neutron matter that the latter response recently obtained in Auxiliary-Field Diffusion Monte-Carlo (AFDMC) can be qualitatively reproduced when the p-wave contribution is added to the functional. Our study indicates that the close similarity between the exact AFDMC static response and the free gas response might stems from the compensation of the as effect by the effective range and p-wave contributions. We finally consider the dynamical response of both atoms or neutron droplets in anisotropic traps. Assuming the hydrodynamical regime and a polytropic equation of state, a reasonable description of the radial and axial collective frequencies in cold atoms is obtained. Following a similar strategy, we estimate the equivalent collective frequencies of neutron drops in anisotropic traps.},

A <b>94</b>, 043614 (2016)</a>] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large \(s\)-wave scattering length as was proposed that has no free parameters. The functional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases together with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at low density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities \(\sim 0.01/{\rm fm}^3\,\) that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang functional, valid for \(\rho < (1/10)^6 / {\rm fm}^3\). The form of the functional retained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional corresponds to an expansion of the energy in \((a_sk_F)\,\) and \((r_ek_F)\,\) to all orders, where re is the effective range and kF is the Fermi momentum. One conclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density regime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in \(âˆ’1/(a_sk_F)\,\) with respect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce density-dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare interaction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some of the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas properties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that the scale in the \(s\)-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the so-called Bertsch parameter \(\xi_0\,\) and becomes independent of as. We also point out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those empirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally propose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate up to the saturation density \(\rho \simeq 0.16 / {\rm fm}^3\).},
